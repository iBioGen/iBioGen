Description: A birth/death process with abundances and genetic diversity at the
    tips. Abundance can evolve either as a BM process with random fission at
    speciation events, or the rate of change (r) of abundance can evolve as BM
    in which case abundance (n) changes through time (dt) via n * exp(r*dt).
    Speciation rate can also shift at branching events in the manner of ClaDS.
